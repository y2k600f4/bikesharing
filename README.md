## Purpose

To analyze the trip data from a bikeshare industry (Citibike) currenty operating in a large city (NYC). The data from Citibike NYC will be used to detetrmine how the industry works by benchmarking this data. This will then be used to create a proposal to create a bikeshare option in a smaller city (Des Moines, IA).

## Results/Analysis

A summary of these results can also be seen from the above Link to the Public Tableau Workbook. Below are screen captures and results from each of the (4) pages of the Tableau story for this Citibike Trip Analysis. The (4) story pages contain (9) unique visualizations.


### Tableau Story page 1

![general overview](https://github.com/y2k600f4/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/general overview.png)

Tableau story page 1 contains 3 visualizations which contain a general overview of the data set. The total number of rides (trips) is shown to be approxiamately 2.3M. In addition the other two visulaizations (pie charts) show a customer breakdown and a gender breakdown. We can determine from these two pie chartsthat user type "subcriber" and Gender "Male" are the primary customers.

### Tableau Story page 2

![bike checkout times by trip and gender](https://github.com/y2k600f4/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/bike checkout times by trip and gender)

Tableau story page 2 contains 2 visualizations. Both plots show a break down of the number of bikes checked out by trip duration. The top plot shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all users. In the second visualization the graph shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender. Both graphs show that shorter trips between ~3-30 minutes are the most popular, with the second graph showing the gender breakdown which again depicts the gender "Male" with the highest bikes checked out.

### Tableau Story page 3

![hourly breakdown of trips by gender](https://github.com/y2k600f4/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/hourly breakdown of trips by gender)

Tableau story page 3 depicts an hourly breakdown of trips by gender by using a single heat map visualization. The darker red boxes show more trips, while the lighter orange boxes show less. This graph shows that 6-8am and 4-7pm  (M-F) are the most popular times to use a CitiBike for both male and females.

### Tableau Story page 4

![weekly breakdown of trips by gender and user type](https://github.com/y2k600f4/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/weekly breakdown of trips by gender and user type)

Tableau story page 4 contains 2 visualizations, both which are heat maps. The heat map to the left is similiar to the previous heat map shown above (Tableau Story page 3), however it combines all genders. Despite gender the most popular trip times are Thursdays from 5-6PM as seen from the darkest (red) areas of the heat map. The graph to the right (blue) shows trips by gender by weekday by user type. 

Observing these heat maps we can conclude there are more users that are subscribers, especially males. Additionally, we can see that Thursdays are the most popular day among male subscribers to use CitiBike and for females, Saturday and Thursday are popular days.



## Summary

In summary the results strongly show  that bikesharing is most popular during typical M-F daytime commute times. In addition is shows males use bikesharing more frequent along with subscribers being the biggest user group. Targeting developing of a bikeshare  operating in other cities should focus on the option of providing an an alternative method of commuting to and from work other than other public transit options currently available.

### Two additional visualizations suggested for future analysis

1. Addition of a map to show starting and stopping  points of routes of each bike that has been checked out and returned. This would help identify the most common routes and justification of adjusting bike inventory for each route according to how popular it is.

2. A chart that graphs useage per individual bike. This would assist in generating which bikes would need periodical maintenance at specifical time intervals.
